HolidayCalendar
===============

This project is currently under construction and is not yet in a fit state to use.


HolidayCalendar is a ruby gem which allows you to specify public holidays in different territories,
and then query whether or not a date is a public holiday or weekend, and calculate the number of working
days between to dates, or what the date is n working_days from (or before) a date.
