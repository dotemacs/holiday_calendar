# implementation of take_before, take_after
# ===========================================

#  - replace carry_forward => true with take_after => [:saturday, :sunday]
#  - implement in yaml files as 
# take_after:
#   - saturday
#   - sunday

# public holiday specification takes these and turns them into day numbers.
# also setup public_holiday - replace carry forward with take before, take after, and carry  forward text with adjustment text



# PROGRESS
# =========

# coding done in PublicHolidaySpecification - now needs to be tested, also test that carry_forward is no longer accepted.
